#Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be:40320
#In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

fact=1
n=int(input())
i=1
while i<=n:
  fact=fact*i;
  i=i+1
print(fact)
